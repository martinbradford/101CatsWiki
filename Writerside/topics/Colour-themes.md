# Colour themes

101Cats is built using the **MahApps** UI framework which supports Theming. You can choose a theme to suit you by updating the **Theme** entry in **config.xml**. The configuration dialogue box does not currently support this, so you'll have to edit the configuration file manually using your favorite text editor. This must be done with some care - instructions are given [here](https://github.com/martinbradford/101Cats/wiki/Configuring-101Cats)

Currently, only MahApps stock themes are supported. A future version may support theme customization. The stock themes are :
			
"Red", "Green", "Blue", "Purple", "Orange", "Lime", "Emerald", "Teal", "Cyan", "Cobalt", "Indigo", "Violet", "Pink", "Magenta", "Crimson", "Amber", "Yellow", "Brown", "Olive", "Steel", "Mauve", "Taupe", "Sienna"

and these base themes:

"Light", "Dark"

I use the following :

`  <Theme>`
    `<BaseTheme>Dark.Cyan</BaseTheme>`
  `</Theme>`

which I find quite readable.

At some point in the future, I'll get round to extending the configuration dialogue box to include theming.
