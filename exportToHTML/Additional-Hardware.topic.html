        <span class="s3">briefly described here. More detailed documentation will be added in the future - if you are in a hurry to try</span>
        <span class="s3">any of these, post a message on the Discussions board requesting additional information.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

        <span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="s3">The FTdx101 has good support for an external SDR connected to one of the RF outputs on the rear panel.</span>
            <span class="s3">101Cats builds on this by offering functionality to interface to a third-party SDR application running on</span>
            <span class="s3">the same PC so that they cooperate. The author uses an SDRPlay RSP1A receiver with the SDR Console</span>
            <span class="s3">application. 101Cats has also interfaced successfully to the SDRUno application offered by SDRPlay although</span>
            <span class="s3">this has not been tested recently. If you try this and find that it does not work, raise it as an issue and</span>
            <span class="s3">it will be fixed.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
