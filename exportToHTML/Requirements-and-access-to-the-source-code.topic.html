    <span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="s3">101Cats is a MS Windows program written in C#. It is unlikely to ever run on any platform other than MS Windows -</span>
        <span class="s3">I develop it for my own use and I run only Windows in the shack.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
    <span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="s3">It was developed under Windows 10 and the development now continues under Windows 11. It will probably run under</span>
        <span class="s3">windows 8, but it is not tested on that platform. Anything earlier than Windows 8 is unlikely to be successful.</span>
        <span class="s3">It is not particularly demanding of the hardware and should run adequately on any PC capable of reasonable</span>
        <span class="s3">performance under Windows. That said, one of the major advantages of 101Cats is its ability to act as the</span>
        <span class="s3">integration hub for multiple other radio related applications such as WSJT-X, Log4OM and FLDigi - by the time</span>
        <span class="s3">you have them also loaded up, the demands on your PC will grow significantly. Until recently, the author ran it</span>
        <span class="s3">very successfully on an AMD Ryzen 5 based PC with 16GB of memory and that machine was able to run simultaneously</span>
        <span class="s3">101Cats, WSJT-X, Log4OM, FLDigi and JS8Call plus SDR-Console while maintaining good performance.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
    <span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="s3">N.B. 101Cats requires that the FTdx101 be connected to the PC via its USB port rather than the RS232 port on the</span>
        <span class="s3">back. Although the radio can be controlled via the RS232 port, Yaesu did not implement the full CAT</span>
        <span class="s3">functionality over it and there are commands that 101Cats requires which are not supported over the RS232</span>
        <span class="s3">connection. This does, unfortunately, rule out the use of 101Cats with a radio that is connected to a SCU-LAN10</span>
        <span class="s3">interface.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
